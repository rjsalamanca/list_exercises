## Sum the Numbers

**Solution is stored in: sum_the_numbers.py**

Given an list of numbers, print their sum. When I say given something, just make something up and store it in a variable.

## Largest Number

**Solution is stored in: largest_number.py**

Given an list of numbers, print the largest of the numbers.

## Smallest Number

**Solution is stored in: smallest_number.py**

Given an list of numbers, print the smallest of the numbers.

## Even Numbers

**Solution is stored in: even_numbers.py**

Given an list of numbers, print each number in the list that is even.

## Positive Numbers

**Solution is stored in: positive_numbers.py**

Given an list of numbers, print each number in the list that is greater than zero.

## Positive Numbers II

**Solution is stored in: positive_numbers_2.py**

Given an list of numbers, create a new list which contains every number in the given list which is positive.

## Multiply a list

**Solution is stored in: multiply_list.py**

Given an list of numbers, and a single factor (also a number), create a new list consisting of each of the numbers in the rst list multiplied by the factor. Print the
new list out to the screen.

## Multiply Vectors

**Solution is stored in: multiply_vectors.py**

Given two lists of numbers of the same length, create a new list by multiplying the pairs of numbers in corresponding positions in the two lists. Example:
```
[2, 4, 5] x [2, 3, 6] = [4, 12, 30]
```

## Matrix Addition

**Solution is stored in: matrix_addition.py**

Given two two-dimensional lists of numbers of the size 2x2 two dimensional list is represented as an list of lists:
```
[ [2, -2],
 [5, 3] ]
```

Calculate the result of adding the two matrices. The number in each position in the resulting matrix should be the sum of the numbers in the corresponding
addend matrices. Example: to add
```
1 3
2 4
```

and

```
5 2
1 0
```

results 

```
6 5
3 4
```

## Matrix Addition II

**Solution is stored in: matrix_addition_2.py**

Use your solution in Matrix Addition, and extend it to work for a pair of matrices of any size, as long as they have the same size.

## De-dup

**Solution is stored in: de_dup.py**

Given an list of numbers or strings, create a new list containing the same elements as the rst list, except with any duplicate values removed. Print the list.

## Bonus: Matrix Multiplication

**Solution is stored in: matrix_multiplication.py**

Given two two-dimensional lists of numbers of the size 2x2 - calculate the result of multiplying the two matrices. Print the resulting matrix.
